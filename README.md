# SAFEGUARD

**System for Active Failure Envelope Governance and Uncertainty-Aware Restraint Decisions**

SAFETY ISN’T A STATE — IT’S A STRATEGY.

**SAFEGUARD** is a reflex layer for intelligent systems. It detects when uncertainty is rising or when the cost of error is escalating—and it acts accordingly. This isn't just fail-safe. It's *fail-smart*.

Where most systems push forward until failure, SAFEGUARD acts like a cautious expert human:  
> “I can keep going with increased caution.”

## 💡 Why SAFEGUARD?

Modern machine learning systems are often:
- Overconfident under degraded inputs
- Unaware of their own operational boundaries
- Designed to act, but not to pause

**SAFEGUARD exists to fix that.** It brings preemptive caution, calibrated restraint, and intelligent awareness to safety-critical ML system.

## 🔧 What It Does

SAFEGUARD:
- **Monitors** the real-time safety envelope of an ML system's subsystems
- **Assesses** where the subsystem performance falls on a comfort-> ugly-but-safe-> unsafe axis
- **Triggers** slowdown, abstention, or override when confidence collapses or physical feasibility degrades

It doesn't just avoid failure — it avoids *bad ways to succeed*.
(Example: rain causes multiple objects to be first detected in the UBS zone.  The ML generated trajectories are slowed until observations are consistently in the comfortable zone.)
